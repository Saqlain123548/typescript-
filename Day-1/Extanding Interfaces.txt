What is an interface?
. An interface defines the (structure of an object) what properties it must have and what there types are .

'' ts  
  interface Transction {
payerAccountNumber:number;
payeeAccountNumber:number;

}

What is extand ?
. the extand keyword is used to inherit properties from another interface it helps us avoid duplication and reuse structure easly. 

''ts 
interface DetailedTransction extend Transction {
amount: number;
date : string ;
status: "Pending" | "Completed" | "Failed";
}

// Here DetailedTransction automatically get 
.payerAccountNumber:number;
.payeeAccountNumber:number;

*and add its own properties:
. amount, date, ,tatus.

Why use extands?

. Reduses duplicate code 
. Makes structure  reusable
. easier to maintain and update 
. keeps large projects clean and organized 

ðŸ’¬ Remember:

"When two interfaces look similar don't copy -- extand"
